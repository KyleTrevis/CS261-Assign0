I was lucky enough in high school to get the oppertunity to travel to Europe for a week with my French class. We went to Dublin, Wales, England, and France. I was able to visit several old forts and cathredrals, explore the European countryside, and even go up the Eiffel Tower and walk along the beaches of D-Day. It was an amazing experience and I hope to return again someday.
